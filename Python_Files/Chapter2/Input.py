# Here we are going to talk about fuctions(built-in/predefined) functions such as input() function :

firstMenWeight = 57

secondMenWeight = 65

thirdMenWeight = 59

fourthMenWeight = 63

Sum = firstMenWeight + secondMenWeight + thirdMenWeight + fourthMenWeight

Average = Sum/4
print(Average) 

firstMenAge = 19

secondMenAge = 20

thirdMenAge = 22

fourthMenAge = 21

sumOfAges = firstMenAge + secondMenAge + thirdMenAge + fourthMenAge

Average2 = sumOfAges/4
print(Average2)

# Now lets practice the input() function :

item1 = input("Enter the name of 1st item :")

item2 = input("Enter the name of 2nd item :")

print("The first item is :", item1)

print("The second item is :", item2)

Sum_Concatenate = item1 + item2
print(Sum_Concatenate)

data1 = int(input("Enter the name of 1st item :"))

data2 = int(input("Enter the name of 2nd item :"))

print("The first item is :", data1)

print("The second item is :", data2)

SumOfNums = data1 + data2
print(SumOfNums)
